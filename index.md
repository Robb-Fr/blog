## Welcome

Welcome to this blog. I am Robb and I will post here stuff I wish someone
explained to me before I spent hours struggling :). I am interested in many
computer related things, but mostly I enjoy browsing about cryptography,
networking security, privacy enhancing technologies, open-source stuff or
software security.

## Studies

I studied at EPFL (Switzerland) for a bachelor and master in Communication
Systems and specialized in cybersecurity with a minor in educational
sciences.

## Job

I am currently working on my master's thesis about developing a WireGuard based
company usable VPN solution!
